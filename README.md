## Project 1: Linked List Implementations and Algorithms

Implemented various linked list data structures in C++, including circular doubly linked lists, move-to-front lists, and transpose lists. Developed driver programs to test and demonstrate core operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and access. This project deepened my understanding of pointers, dynamic memory management, and foundational data structure algorithms essential for efficient data organization.

## Project 2: Binary Tree Implementation and Testing

Designed and implemented a binary tree data structure with support for insertion, traversal, and searching functionalities. Created comprehensive test drivers and input/output datasets to ensure robustness and correctness. This project enhanced my skills in recursive programming and memory management within hierarchical data models.

## Project 3: Graph Data Structures and Algorithms

Built graph representations using adjacency lists and matrices, implementing traversal algorithms including DFS and BFS. Supported reading graph data from external files and outputting traversal results. This project strengthened my grasp of graph theory concepts and their computational applications.

## Project 4: Media Rental Store System

Developed a feature-rich media rental store system using C++, incorporating object-oriented principles like inheritance and polymorphism. Implemented classes such as Movie, Customer, Transaction, and Store to manage borrowing, returning, and inventory operations. Utilized hash tables for efficient data retrieval and created command parsers for processing input files with customer actions and store commands. This project honed my ability to design modular and scalable software systems reflecting real-world business logic.
